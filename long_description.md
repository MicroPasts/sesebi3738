This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society excavations at Sesebi 
between 1937 - 1938 under the direction of Herbert Walter Fairman. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and 
redisplayed in the browser window. They would like the following information to be transcribed for them to create a 
searchable archive for their records. 

These fields are:

* Description
* Object number
* Provenance
* Distribution
* Your comments
* Scale

The object cards have been scanned by EES volunteer Elissa Day as part of the 2015 volunteer projects.
